Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.\n\nDr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\n\nOur devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.\n\n\nAbout the role:\n\n\nThe successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.\n\n\nAbout you:\n\n\nApplications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project. Shortlisted candidates should be available for interview.\n\nIndigenous Australians seeking support to apply for a vacancy are encouraged to contact the University by emailing their contact details and position number to law-hr@unimelb.edu.au\n\nAdvertised: 18 Nov 2020 12:05 AM AUS Eastern Daylight Time\n\nApplications close: 09 Dec 2020 11:55 PM AUS Eastern Daylight Time""]"

Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.\n\nDr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\n\nOur devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.\n\n\nAbout the role:\n\n\nThe successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.\n\n\nAbout you:\n\n\nApplications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project.

Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.\n\nDr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\n\nOur devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs.

Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.\n\nDr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\n\nOur devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.\n\n\nAbout the role:\n\n\nThe successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.\n\n\nAbout you:\n\n\nApplications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project. Shortlisted candidates should be available for interview.\n\nIndigenous Australians seeking support to apply for a vacancy are encouraged to contact the University by emailing their contact details and position number to law-hr@unimelb.edu.au\n\nAdvertised: 18 Nov 2020 12:05 AM AUS Eastern Daylight Time\n\nApplications close: 09 Dec 2020 11:55 PM AUS Eastern Daylight Time""]"

Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.\n\nDr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\n\nOur devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.\n\n\nAbout the role:\n\n\nThe successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.\n\n\nAbout you:\n\n\nApplications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project. Shortlisted candidates should be available for interview.\n\nIndigenous Australians seeking support to apply for a vacancy are encouraged to contact the University by emailing their contact details and position number to law-hr@unimelb.edu.au\n\nAdvertised: 18 Nov 2020 12:05 AM AUS Eastern Daylight Time\n\nApplications close: 09 Dec 2020 11:55 PM AUS Eastern Daylight Time""]"

Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.\n\nDr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\n\nOur devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.\n\n\nAbout the role:\n\n\nThe successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.\n\n\nAbout you:\n\n\nApplications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project.

Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.\n\nDr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\n\nOur devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts.

Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.\n\nDr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.\n\n\nAbout the project:\n\n\nOur devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.\n\n\nAbout the role:\n\n\nThe successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.\n\n\nAbout you:\n\n\nApplications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project.
